This is an implementation of the collaborative filtering techniques for a movie recommendation system. The given data is about movie ratings provided by 200 users for 1000 movies. Each rating is a value between 1 and 5, where 1 indicates the least favored and 5 represents the most favored rating. The data is in the format of a file containing 200 blocks, with each block representing a user and containing lines with the user ID, movie ID, and corresponding rating. There are three test files named test5.txt, test10.txt, and test20.txt. Test5.txt contains movie ratings provided by 100 users (user ID: 201-300), where each user has rated 5 movies. The test file also contains some ratings with a value of 0, for which the task is to predict the best possible rating the user would give to that movie. Each block in the test file represents a user and contains lines with the user ID, movie ID, and rating given by the user, or 0 if a prediction is required. The following is a block for user 276 :

276 42 4 // user 276 gives movie 42 4 points
276 85 2 // user 276 gives movie 85 2 points 
276 194 5 // user 276 gives movie 194 5 points
276 208 5  // user 276 gives movie 208 5 points
276 585 1 // user 276 gives movie 585 1 point
276 4 0 // need to predict user 276's rating for movie 4
276 26 0 // need to predict user 276's rating for movie 26
276 33 0 ...
276 56 0 
276 63 0 
276 67 0 
276 72 0

The structure of test10.txt and test20.txt is similar to test5.txt, with the only difference being the number of ratings given by a user. In test10.txt, each user has provided ratings for 10 movies, while in test20.txt, each user has rated 20 movies.
